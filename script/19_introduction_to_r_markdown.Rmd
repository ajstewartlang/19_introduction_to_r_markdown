# Overview

In this workshop we will briefly examine how we can use R Markdown to generate reports that contain a blend of narrative, code, and the output of that code. 

In the following video I will give you a brief overview of how you can turn a script you have written in R into an R Markdown document that you can 'knit' and share with others.
